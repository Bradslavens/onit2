    <h2>How it Works</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Complete your FREE registration</li>
        (All you need to Register is your Name and Email)
        <li>Once you complete your registration, we'll set up an alert on our MLS account. Any time your name appears on a transaction in Sandicor, we'll receive a notification. 
        <li>When you receive your acceptance request, click accept. We'll get started sending you document requests, downloading info from the MLS and setting up the file in Zipforms.
        </li>
        <li>All documents will go to you first for review, before going to your client.</li>
        <li>We can send documents via, Docusign, Fax, email or first class mail, to your client.</li>
